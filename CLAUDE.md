# Working in this repo

Vision OCR — macOS SwiftUI app that OCRs scanned PDFs via the `mac-ocr`
CLI and writes its own searchable-PDF text layer.

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing anything** — branch,
failing test first, adversarial review of your own diff, and a pre-commit hook
that refuses a commit whose tests do not pass. It exists because this project has
repeatedly shipped regressions *inside fixes for other bugs*.

Then: [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the design rationale and the mistakes already
paid for, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the call path, the two page
boxes, and what the tests don't cover.

Planning lives in three files: [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) is the defect register (nothing
open; three decisions went against the obvious fix and say why — update it in the
same commit as any fix), [TODO.md](TODO.md) is decided-but-undone work, and
[FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) is ideas with their costs and the reasons some are
parked.

Install the hook once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## Commands

```sh
./build.sh            # build -> build/VisionOCR.app
./build.sh --install  # + install to /Applications
./run_tests.sh        # 473 checks, 2-4 min; runs real OCR, needs mac-ocr
```

Never report a change as working without `./run_tests.sh` passing. Add a test that
fails without the fix.

## Invariants — breaking these has destroyed user content before

1. **Never lose content silently.** Every path that can drop a page, a line or a
   text layer must report it. Page count is not sufficient verification; a
   truncated-but-valid PDF opens fine. Prefer failing loudly over publishing
   something plausible.
2. **Build into scratch, publish only on success.** `makeSearchablePDF` stages
   output and moves it into place after verifying the page count. Never write
   directly to the user's destination — a cancel mid-write once overwrote a good
   file with a truncated one.
3. **The text layer must satisfy four properties at once**: word spacing survives
   extraction, runs don't overlap vertically, runs span the ink, and **runs keep
   a gap from the next fragment on their own line**. Each has been broken by a
   fix to another. Re-measure all of them (`Tools/score-line-separation.swift`,
   `Tools/probe-line-edges.swift`, `Tools/probe-text-offset.swift`, and the
   `words=` column of `Tools/score-corpus.swift`) after any change to
   `SearchableWriter`.

   The fourth was found late and had been holding **by accident**. Vision splits
   one visual line into fragments side by side; nothing writes a space character
   between them, so PDFKit synthesises one from the geometric gap and stops
   below ~0.15 em. That gap existed only as slack left over from
   `minimumVertical` capping the font size — a constant chosen for something
   else. Widening runs to fix property three closed it, and words welded:
   `valuablestudy`. `reserveEms` now holds it open deliberately. Assume there is
   a fifth.
4. **`kCGPDFContextMediaBox` takes CFData, not NSValue.** An NSValue is silently
   ignored and every page inherits page 1's size.
5. **Test fixtures need ≥2 pages of differing size**, and at least one rotated
   page. Single-page fixtures are structurally blind to geometry bugs.

## Environment traps

- **Backgrounded shell commands have essentially no `PATH`** — `basename`, `cut`,
  `timeout` fail silently and loops report bogus results. Use absolute paths.
- **`nohup … &` reports success immediately** while the real work runs orphaned.
  Wait on the process; don't trust the exit code.
- Zotero locks `zotero.sqlite`; copy it before querying.
- Filenames here may contain non-breaking spaces (U+00A0). Glob, don't retype.
- The volume is case-insensitive: `tools/` and `Tools/` are the same directory.

## Verification discipline

When a measurement is surprising, suspect the instrument first. Several
"confirmed" findings in this project's history were artifacts: `difflib` autojunk
on repetitive text, a glob matching unrelated files, ImageMagick's `AE` exceeding
the pixel count, a probe counting short lines as failures. State plainly whether a
finding was verified by running code or only reasoned about.

Prefer editing with `Edit` over scripted text-slicing on source files. An
over-broad Python slice once deleted four functions from `Model.swift`; with no
version control at the time they had to be reconstructed from memory.

## Not committed

`testdocs/` — 302 MB of third-party copyrighted PDFs. `testdocs/manifest.tsv` and
`Tools/sample-zotero.py` let it be rebuilt from a Zotero library.
